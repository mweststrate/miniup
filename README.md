# Miniup - the pragmatic parsing library

## A short introduction to miniup
Welcome to Miniup, the pragmatic parsing library. Miniup is a pragmatic parsing library that is strongly inspired by context-free grammar parsing libraries such as Stratego/XT. Miniup offers grammars in a pragmatic and therefor easy-to-use way.

### The pragmatism of Miniup:

* _Easy-to-write grammars._ Miniup offers built-in support for common concepts such as lists, operators and choices. These concepts avoids the need of the grammar writer to be aware of the underlying parsing algorithm and its typical drawbacks.
* _Context-free parsing algorithm._ Miniup applies no lexical analysis before parsing and is therefor a context-free parser. This means the parser can switch between different languages during the parse process
* _Friendly AST._ The AST generated by the Miniup parser is very intuitive.
* _No intermediate code._ Miniup does not generate a parser, it is a parser. You can hook up miniup directly in your java / javascript / typescript environment without needing intermediate compilation steps.

* _ **No** support for semantics _ Many parser generators allow semantic actions do be defined inside a grammar. However, this kills the readability of a grammar, makes interoperability with other environments very hard and prevent parser to do some automatic refactorings on the grammar. In fact, the allowance for semantic actions mixes two concerns which should be separated in my humble opininion: Parsing input to an AST, and interpreting an AST to do something sensible with it. An other import feature of semantic actions is that it allows to build 'nice' AST's. However, in miniup this is done automatically thanks to the common concepts.

### How does miniup do that?

In contrast to LL or LR based parsing algorithms, rules in Miniup are not defined by using BNF. In miniup, rules are defined by referring to common concepts typically encountered in most programming languages. Concepts such as 'infix operator' or 'list'. This gives Miniup an edge over parsers that do not support this concept. First of all, writing grammars is easier, the author is not required to know which kind of parsing algoritm is applied to be able to write a working grammar. Second, the AST produced by miniup is built up in such a way that it reflects these concepts.
